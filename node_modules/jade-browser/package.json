It provides a few additional features like express-like render function with partial handling.\n  \n```javascript\nvar express = require('express')\n  , jade_browser = require('jade-browser')\n  , app = express.createServer();\n  \napp.use(jade_browser(url_endpoint, template_dir, options));\n```\n\nor for Express.js v3.x:\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express')\n  , jade_browser = require('jade-browser')\n  , app = express();\n  \napp.use(jade_browser(url_endpoint, template_dir, options));\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install jade-browser\n  \n## Features\n\n  * Jade templates are served as compiled functions.\n    * removes browser compatibility issues\n    * increases speed of template execution\n    * reduces file transfer size\n  * ability to minify output\n  * option to attach cache control\n  * provides helpers for handling rendering/partials just like express.\n  * relative path handling even from within partials.\n  * ability to completely namespace to avoid any naming collisions on the browser.\n  * partials inherit parent locals\n\n## Usage\n\n### In Node.js\n\n  As middleware jade-browser is simple to use.\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express')\n  , jade_browser = require('jade-browser')\n  , app = express.createServer();\n\napp.use(jade_browser('/js/templates.js', '**', options));\n```\n\n### Params\n\n  - `filename`  The filename of the resulting compiled templates file\n  - `patterns`  A single string or array of patterns used to glob for template files\n  - `options`   Options object, see below (optional)\n\n#### Options\n\n  - `root`      The root of the views (default: __dirname)\n  - `namespace` Namespace for the browser (default: 'jade')\n  - `minify`    Minifies the output (default: false)\n  - `maxAge`    Time in seconds to cache the results (default: 86400)\n  - `noCache`   Recompiles the output on every request (default: false)\n  \n### Browser\n\n```javascript\njade.render('path/to/template', { values: for_template });\n```\n    \nFor direct access (for templates that have no need for partials).\n\n```javascript\njade.templates['path/to/template.jade'](locals);\n```\n    \nNote: With render '.jade' extension is not required. Relative paths can be used in templates and in render function.\n\n```javascript\njade.render('path/../to/../test');\n```\n\n## Credits\n\n  Large amounts of this code is inspired by TJ. Parts of express-expose and internal parts of express are recycled to make this happen. Contibuting docs part is taken from [Mongoosastic](https://github.com/storify/mongoosastic/blob/master/readme.md).\n\n## Contributors\n\nThe list of contributors according to `git shortlog -s -n`:\n\n* 15  Conner Petzold ([cpetzold](http://github.com/cpetzold))\n* 12  Nathan White ([nw](http://github.com/nw))\n* 9  Azat Mardanov\n* 4  Patrick Forringer\n* 2  Vincent Battaglia\n* 2  Arlo Breault\n* 2  RashFael\n* 1  Adrian Bravo ([adrianbravo](http://github.com/adrianbravo))\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests are always welcome as long as an accompanying test case is\nassociated. \n\nThis project is configured to use [git\nflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/) and the following conventions\nare used:\n\n* ``dev`` - represents current active development and can possibly be\n  unstable. \n\n* ``master`` - pristine copy of repository, represents the currently\n  stable release found in the npm index.\n\n* ``feature/**`` - represents a new feature being worked on\n\nIf you wish to contribute, the only requirement is to: \n\n- branch a new feature branch from develop (if you're working on an\n  issue, prefix it with the issue number)\n- make the changes, with accompanying test cases\n- issue a pull request against develop branch\n\nAlthough I use git flow and prefix feature branches with \"feature/\" I\ndon't require this for pull requests... all I care is that the feature\nbranch name makes sense. \n\nPulls requests against master or pull requests branched from master will\nbe rejected.\n\n#### Examples\n\nExamples of good branch names:\n\n* 12-amd-support\n* feature/12-amd-support\n\n\n### Running Tests\n\nIn order to run the tests which are in `test` folder, you will need:\n\n* Node.js\n* NPM\n\nWith those installed, running `npm install` and ''npm test'' will run the tests.\n\n    \n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2009-2011 Storify &lt;info@storify.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
